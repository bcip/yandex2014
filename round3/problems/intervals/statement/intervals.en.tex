Little Artem wants to found a startup. He is sure it will become successful. At this moment, Artem doesn't want to tell anybody his great ideas, but he needs some help.

Artem has many plans and tasks, but he doesn't have a lot of time. He wants you to help him with one of the tasks.

You are given an array of integers. You need to find the number of different pairs $(l, r)$ ($l < r$) such that the difference between some two elements from different positions among $a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$ equals to $d$. More formally, there must exist such $i$ and $j$ that $l \le i, j \le r$, $i \neq j$ and $a_i - a_j = d$.

\InputFile
The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $d$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$, $-10^9 \le d \le 10^9$). The next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ separated by spaces ($-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$).

\OutputFile
Output a single integer: the number of different pairs $(l, r)$ with the required property.
