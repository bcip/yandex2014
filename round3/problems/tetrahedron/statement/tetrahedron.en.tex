\begin{problem}{Tetrahedron}{\textsl{standard input}}{\textsl{standard input}}{1 second}{256 mebibytes}{}


Artem found a tetrahedron.
He put it on a horizontal desk, the surface of which coincides with the plane $z = 0$, so that the coordinates of all vertices of the tetrahedron happened to be integers.
After that, Artem released the tetrahedron, leaving it to the force of gravity directed downwards.

Artem wonders whether the tetrahedron is standing stable, is in an unstable position, or will fall.
It is known that the tetrahedron is homogenous, that is, the mass of any part of it is proportional to the volume of that part.
Help him to answer this question.

\InputFile
The input consists of four lines; $i$-th of these lines contains three integers $x_i$, $y_i$ and $z_i$ which are the coordinates of $i$-th vertex of the tetrahedron.

The coordinates are such that $-1000 \le x_i, y_i, z_i \le 1000$, $z_1 = z_2 = z_3 = 0$ and $z_4 > 0$.

It is guaranteed that the tetrahedron has non-zero volume.

\OutputFile
If the tetrahedron will stay stable on the desk, print ``\texttt{Standing}'',
if it is in an unstable position, print ``\texttt{Unstable}'',
and if it will fall, print ``\texttt{Falling}''.
