Artem likes games. He always plays different games with his friends and always wins. What helps Artem to win? He is smart, and he creates these games himself.

Now he is working on a new game. In this game, two players are given an $1 \times n$ board that is initially colored white. Players take turns alternatively. On each turn, a player can paint a segment of consecutive white cells of length $L$ with black color. If a player cannot make his turn, he loses the game.

Now you need to help Artem do an analysis of the game. He wants to figure out who will win the game for each value of $L$ from $1$ to $n$, inclusive. You can assume that both players play optimally.

\InputFile
You are given a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 7000$).

\OutputFile
Print a single line containing $n$ characters. The $i$-th character must be equal to ``\texttt{F}'' if the first player wins when $L = i$. Otherwise, the $i$-th character must be equal to ``\texttt{S}''.

\Examples

}{SFSFFFFF
