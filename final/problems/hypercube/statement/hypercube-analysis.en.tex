This is easiest problem of this problemset.

It is obvious that the number of dimensions of the parallelepiped
is not less than the number $D$ of distinct lenghts of given sticks.
Also note that $K$-dimensional parallelepiped contains $2^{K-1}$ edges
of the same type (i.e. parallel to same coordinate axis),
and in the case that we have $X$ sticks of the same length,
$[(X-1)/2^{K-1}]+1$ dimensions must be used to have $X$ or more edges.

So we will let $K=D$ and sum these values for all sets of sticks of same size.
If the sum is less than $K$, the answer is found, else increase $K$
and calculate the sum again.
Note that for $K=21$, the number of edges of the same type is equal to
$2^{20} > 10^6$, so the number of steps in our algorithm will be very small.
