\begin{problem}{UFO}{stdin}{stdout}{1 second}{512 megabytes}

Last night, an UFO crash landed in a small lake near Vasya's home. 

UFO was constructed as an $N$-dimensional rectangular parallelepiped with integer lengths of edges.
At the moment of crash, the joints and all the other parts of UFO except for titanium edges were burned out.
The edges themselves however did not break.

In the morning, Vasya came to the lake and found $K$ titanium sticks.
Assuming that those sticks are edges of an UFO and that some of those edges are still under water, find out the minimum possible number of dimensions $N$ of the place where this UFO was from.

\InputFile
The first line of input contains one integer $K$ ($1 \le K \le 10^6$) which is the number of sticks found by Vasya.
The second line contains $K$ space-separated integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^6$) which are the lengths of the sticks.

\OutputFile
Print one integer: the minimum possible number of dimensions $N$ of the place where UFO came from.
