Consider pair of strings $s$ and $w$. String $s$ is \emph{almost less} than
string $w$ when and only when string $s^{min}$
(lexicographically minimal string which can be obtained from $s$
by replacing exactly one letter) is strictly less than $w$.

But it is easy to see that $s^{min}$ can be obtained from $s$
in the following way:
replace first character not equal to ``\texttt{a}'' with character
``\texttt{a}''; if $s$ contans only ``\texttt{a}''s, then $s=s^{min}$,

Consider string $s_i$ and then lets find $C_i$: the number of strings
$s_j$ (possibly $i=j$) such as $s_i^{min} < s_j$.
It adds to answer $C_i-1$, if $s_i^{min} \ne s_i$, and $C_i$ otherwise.

To calculate values of $C_i$ two ways can be used:

\begin{itemize}
\item sort all $s_i$ and then use binary search to find $C_i$;
\item add all strings to a \textsl{trie} and then find $C_i$ by
descending on it.
\end{itemize}
