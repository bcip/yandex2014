To solve this problem, we can notice that the number of vertices
on the left side is small.
We can calculate the recursion $f(i,j)$: the number of ways to assign
the edges if we have already taken the first $i$ vertices on the right side;
then $j$ is a mask in 3-base system describing the vertices on the left side
in the next way:

\begin{itemize}
\item $0$ means a vertex couldn't be assigned to any vertex on the right side,
\item $1$ means a vertex could be assigned to some vertex on the right side,
but wasn't and still is not assigned to any vertex on the right side,
\item $2$ means a vertex is connected with edge to some vertex
on the right side.
\end{itemize}

When we take the next vertex from the right side,
we can calculate the new 3-based mask for the vertices on the left side.
To find the answer, we should take only the masks without 1 in then
(there shouldn't exist a vertex that could be assigned to some other vertex).
So the answer is the sum of $f(n_2,ValidMasks)$, where $ValidMasks$ is
an element of the set of all masks which don't contain 1 in their
3-based representation.
