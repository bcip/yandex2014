\begin{problem}{Unextendable Matching}{stdin}{stdout}{1 second}{512 megabytes}

Artemka likes matchings very much.

A \textit{matching} in an undirected graph is a set of pairwise disjoint edges.

A matching is called \textit{unextendable} if it is impossible to add an edge into it without excluding any edges which are already present in the matching.

An undirected graph is called \textit{bipartite} if it is possible to divide its vertices into two sets in such a way that each edge connects vertices from different sets.

Artemka has a bipartite graph. His task is to count the number of distinct unextendable matchings in the graph modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$ ($10^9 + 7$). Your task is to help him.

\InputFile
The first line contains three integers $n_1$, $n_2$ and $m$ ($1 \le n_1 \le 10$, $1 \le n_2 \le 100$, $0 \le m \le n_1 \cdot n_2$): the number of vertices in two parts and the number of edges, respectively. The next $m$ lines contain the description of edges of the given graph. Each of these lines contains two integers $v_1$ and $v_2$ ($1 \le v_1 \le n_1$, $1 \le v_2 \le n_2$) which mean that an edge connects vertex $v_1$ of first part and vertex $v_2$ of second part. It is guaranteed that all the edges are unique.

\OutputFile
Print a single integer: the number of unextendable matchings modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$ ($10^9 + 7$).
